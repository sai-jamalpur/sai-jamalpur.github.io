I am a Ph.D. scholar at IIIT-Delhi, supervised by [Prof. Mukesh Mohania](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/mukesh) and [Prof. Vikram Goyal](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/vikram). My research focuses on the development of multimodal architectures and representation learning. Currently, I am working on the development of small-scale video generation models that are suitable for resource-scarce environments. I am also exploring efficient representations of various modalities to enable more effective and efficient machine learning.

Complementing my technical pursuits, I am also a dedicated student of philosophy and history, seeking to contextualize the broader implications of the intelligence we are constructing.
