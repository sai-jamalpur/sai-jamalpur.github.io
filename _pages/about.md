I am a Ph.D. scholar at IIIT-Delhi, supervised by [Prof. Mukesh Mohania](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/mukesh) and [Prof. Vikram Goyal](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/vikram). My research focuses on the development of large-scale multimodal architectures at the intersection of generative video models and distributed systems. Specifically, I address the complex engineering challenges involved in designing scalable infrastructure for training next-generation models.

Complementing my technical pursuits, I am also a dedicated student of philosophy and history, seeking to contextualize the broader implications of the intelligence we are constructing.
### Interests

*   **Video Generation:** Diffusion models, temporal consistency, and efficient inference.
*   **Distributed Training:** Multi-GPU/Multi-node optimisation and large-scale infrastructure.

Feel free to reach out to [me](mailto:saij@iiitd.ac.in) for collaborations on generative AI and my broader research interests.
