I am a PhD student specialising in the development of large-scale multimodal architectures. My research operates at the nexus of Generative Video Models and Distributed Systems, where I focus on architecting the complex engineering infrastructure required to train next-generation models.

Driven by a pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical scalability. My work aims to endow machines with capabilities that traditionally require human intuition, translating abstract research into efficient, deployable systems. Outside of managing compute clusters, I am an avid student of philosophy and human history, seeking to understand the broader contexts of the intelligence we are building.

### Interests

*   **Video Generation:** Diffusion models, temporal consistency, and efficient inference.
*   **Distributed Training:** Multi-GPU/Multi-node optimisation and large-scale infrastructure.

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations on generative AI or systems research.
